🎯 Requirements
1. Game Features
3x3 grid (9 cells)

Two players: X and O

Players take turns placing their mark

Detect the winner or a draw

Display game status: who’s next or who won

Restart/reset button to play again

2. UI Design
Use tailwind css

Centered game board

Highlight the winning combination (3 in a row)

Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)

3. Code Structure
Use functional components with React hooks (useState, useEffect)

Suggested component breakdown:

<App />: Main component

<Board />: Renders the 3x3 grid

<Square />: Represents each cell

Optional: <Status /> for displaying current game status

4. Game Logic
Maintain game state using useState

Keep track of:

Current player

Board state (array of 9 elements)

Winner

On each move:

Update board

Check for winner or draw

Switch players

5. Optional Enhancements
(If time permits or for bonus features)

Move history (time travel)

AI bot for single-player mode (minimax or random)

Score counter for X and O

Dark/light theme toggle

6. Code Style
Clean and readable code with comments where necessary

Follow naming conventions

Use ES6+ syntax

🧪 Testing (optional)
Brief explanation of how the logic handles edge cases (e.g., clicking a filled square, fast clicks)

Show how the winning condition logic works (e.g., using winning combinations array)

📁 Output Format
A complete src folder with:

App.js

Board.js

Square.js

index.js

App.css (or inline styling)

Or: a single-file React component (if simplified)

🧠 Reminder
Before coding, analyze the game structure and plan the component hierarchy. Once done, implement in a modular, maintainable way.
